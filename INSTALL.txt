 DESCRIPTION:

 This bundles provides a set of Python programmable filters/sources to allow ParaView open-source, multi-platform data
 analysis and visualization application to display EMC netCDF models along with other auxiliary Earth data. Once this
 bundle is installed, the EMC plugins will appear in ParaView under the "Sources --> IRIS EMC" and
 "Filters --> IRIS EMC" menus. For information on the contents of this bundle see the CONTENTS section below.

 NOTE: To use these plugins, you need basic familiarity with ParaView and how it operates. Please see ParaView Getting
 Started Guide and ParaViewTutorial:
     https://www.paraview.org/download/


 REQUIREMENTS:

     - ParaView: This bundle was created and tested using ParaView 5.6.0 under Mac OS X 10.13.36. Compatibility
       tests were conducted under:
          Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS) on VirtualBox 5.2 on Mac OS X host
          Windows 10 Home (64-Bit)
       ParaView can be downloaded from https://www.paraview.org/.

     - Python: ParaView comes with its own Python 2.7.10 and as such Python 2.7 installation is needed to support
       installation of this package. This bundle was created and tested under Python 2.7.13.


 BUNDLE INSTALLATION:
   
     - Place the bundle where you want to install and unzip and untar the package. The content of packages will be
       installed under the "IRIS_EMC_Paraview" directory. Under this directory the src, src/filters, src/macros and
       src/readers directories and their contents are required for installation and will be created during unpacking.
       Other needed directories will be created by the script during the build process.

     NOTE: This bundle will NOT create directories outside the IRIS_EMC_Paraview installation directory.
     NOTE: As stated above, this bundle uses Python 2.7 for installation

    - Install the bundle by executing the Python 2.7 script "build_plugins_macros.py" under the src directory.

    If the "build_plugins_macros.py" execution is successful, you should see three new directories under the
    "IRIS_EMC_Paraview" directory:
        plugins - Under this directory you will find a series of XML files that are wrappers for the Python plugin
            scripts that reside under src/filters and src/readers directories
    	macros - Under this directory you will find macros that are created based on the macro templates under
    	    src/macros
    	data - This directory does not contain any data files after the installation step, however, it will be used to
    	    save data files as they are downloaded during ParaView runs.
 
 ADDING PLUGINS TO PARAVIEW:
    - In ParaView go to "Tools --> Manage Plugins.." and a Plugin Manager window opens. As you see from this window,
        you have two options:
           * Option 1: Click on the "Load New" button and change the file type to xml and load plugins from the
                IRIS_EMC_Paraview/plugins directory. These plugins will remain active during this ParaView session but
                you have to reload them after each ParaView restart

           * Option 2: As indicated on top of the Plugin Manager window, you may place your plugin files under the
                designated plugin directory so they would be loaded automatically. A better option would be to assign
                this directory to the "EMC_PLUGINS_PATH" parameter in IrisEMC_Paraview_Param.py so every time you
                rebuild the bundle, plugins get updated. However, this option requires granting full permission to
                user for accessing this directory.
                       
    - Restart ParaView
    - In ParaView go to "Sources --> IRIS EMC" to see various EMC sources you have installed
    - In ParaView go to "Filters--> IRIS EMC" to see the single EMC filter you have installed (it should be grayed out
        since you have no data to filter yet!)


 USAGE:

 IRIS EMC plugin installation is now complete and you may now start using them as described in README.txt document of
 this package.


CONTENTS:

The package comes with the following directories and files:


IRIS_EMC_Paraview/src:
----------------------
   Directory of all the installation scripts and plugin/macro scripts


- src/IrisEMC_Paraview_Lib.py
    IRIS EMC ParaView support Python library of functions called by the plugins

- src/IrisEMC_Paraview_Param.py
    IRIS EMC ParaView support Python parameter file that contains parameters accessed by the plugins
    User may change these parameters to change the default startup values.

- src/IrisEMC_Paraview_Utils.py
    IRIS EMC ParaView support Python library of utility functions called by the plugins

- src/build_plugins_macros.py
    A Python script to build the bundle. Anytime user modifies any of the python scripts, this script must be executed
    to update the plugins and macros

- src/python_filter_generator.py
